# Mini-Siri
Hello world! This is a "mini siri" program I put together with pure Python and OpenAI's Whisper and Chatbot APIs. The personality of the chatbot is completely programmable â€”Â see [Personalizing Mini-Siri](#-Personalizing-Mini-Siri)

I'm currently hosting the site to make it more accessible. The end goal for this project is to create a therapy chatbot that can make CPT therapy more accessible for those who are in need.

Before that's ready, below is a demo video and some instructions to get the terminal version set up locally. Have fun!

### Demonstration Video
