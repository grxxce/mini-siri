# Mini-Siri
Hello world! This is a "mini siri" program I put together with pure Python and OpenAI's Whisper and Chatbot APIs. The personality of the chatbot is completely programmable — see [Personalizing Mini-Siri](#-Personalizing-Mini-Siri)

I'm currently hosting the site to make it more accessible. The end goal for this project is to create a therapy chatbot that can make CPT therapy more accessible for those who are in need.

Before that's ready, below is a demo video and some instructions to get the terminal version set up locally. Have fun!

### Demonstration Video

Here's a [demonstration video]([url](https://youtu.be/Kfcs3nlMqlM

# Installation
### Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/grxxce/mini-chatbot.git
```

### Install the dependencies
```
pip install openai
brew install portaudio
pip install pyaudio
npm install wave
```
Note that some of these dependencies may require ```sudo``` permision.

### Add your API key
Head to your [ChatGPT4](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) account to create your API key. Create a ```config.py``` file and set ```api_key``` equal to the key you create.

You're ready to go! Just follow the instructions in terminal and converse with ```Mini-Siri``` to your heart's desire 😄.
